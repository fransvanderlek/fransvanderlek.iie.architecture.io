						<div class="convertlinks documentation" style="white-space:pre-wrap">Typically, two views of a I4.0 Component are needed:
- a view of how a component works internally, used for the reasoning and designing components. This is adressed via the I4.0 Component Implementation View, one or more diagrames describing the implementation of a component.
- a summarized view of how a component behaves and looks from the outside, used by other components that make use of them. In such cases, what is desired is a stable description of the component, which will not change if the implementation changes. This is adressed via the I4.0 Component Manifest View, one or more diagrames describing how a component 'manifests' itself to the outside world. 

Note that while the archimate language supports the concept of inferred relations, which automatically creates relations that can function as a summary, this is still based on implementation details. Should the implementation change, there is no guarantee that the same inferred relations will be still be there. I.e.: the inferred relations do not provide a guaranteed description that is stable against internal changes. 

The manifest view shows what interfaces, components and behaviors are exposed by the I4.0 Component to it's environment.
It serves as a contract whereby the I4.0 Component author or vendor will keep the manifest stable. 
Users of the I4.0 Component should only use artefacts and relationships shown in the manifest.

Details on how a I4.0 Component works from the inside can be found in the I4.0 Component Implementation view. Any artefacts on that view should be considerd private and never to be refered from outside, unless they appear in the manifest view as well.

For each component, a manifest grouping is created for that component, and placed inside the manifest view. elements that are part of the manifest are related to this grouping artefact via a composition relation.
Elements from other manifests may be used as well, to express what a component depends on. These elements are related via a aggregates relation, since they are not owned by the component but rather are
imported from others. In this way, the manifest becomes part of the model itself, making it easier to determine what elements are declared usable outside the component, and also to enforce modelling rules via e.g. scripting.

This modelleing convention also makes the whole model more manageable as:
- only information that is considered stable will be used in the wider model, while unstable information is compartimentalized. Since the manifest descriptions are typically a smaller portion of the overall model, that also means that large parts of the model can safely be changed without side-effects
- there is a natural way to break-up the model in loosely coupled parts, making it easier to understand and extend

These properties become crucial when scaling to a large model that needs to be maintained by a large team.
